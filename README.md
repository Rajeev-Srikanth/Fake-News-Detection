# Fake News Detection

This project tackles the challenge of identifying fake news using natural language processing and machine learning. By combining text cleaning, lemmatization, and semantic embedding with Word2Vec, we extract meaningful patterns from news content. 

Exploratory analysis highlights linguistic differences between real and fake news, while supervised models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained to classify articles. Logistic Regression emerged as the best performer with an F1 score of 92.8%, balancing precision and recall effectively for misinformation detection.
